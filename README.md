Overview

This project demonstrates the use of IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 to create a linear regression model. The model predicts the target variable (dependent variable) based on one or more predictor variables (independent variables). This README provides an overview of the steps taken to create and evaluate the model, as well as how to interpret the results.

Prerequisites

IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 installed

A dataset suitable for linear regression modeling

Basic understanding of linear regression and statistical analysis

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains both numeric and categorical variables. It includes the following columns:

Dependent Variable: The target variable (e.g., "Sales", "Price", etc.).

Independent Variables: Predictor variables used to model the dependent variable (e.g., "Advertising Budget", "Years of Experience", etc.).

Steps to Build the Model

Import Data:

Load the dataset into IBM SPSS Modeler using the File > Import option.

Ensure the data is clean (e.g., handle missing values, remove duplicates).

Preprocess Data:

Use the Select node to filter relevant columns.

For categorical variables, use the Type node to convert them into numeric form if required (e.g., dummy encoding).

Scale or standardize continuous variables using the Fuzzy Match node if necessary.

Build the Linear Regression Model:

Drag the Linear Regression node into the model canvas.

Connect the dataset to the node.

Select the dependent variable and independent variables for the regression analysis.

Configure the settings to use either the Stepwise or Enter method for variable selection.

Run the Model:

Execute the model and generate the output.

Conclusion
The linear regression model created using IBM SPSS Modeler 18.0 can be used to predict the dependent variable based on the selected independent variables. Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using R-squared, p-values, and residual analysis.
